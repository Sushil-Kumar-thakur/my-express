        Installing & using Nodemon for auto-restart

        📦 2. Core Concepts
        Middleware (very important)

        Application-level

        Router-level

        Built-in

        Third-party

        Custom

        Error-handling

        Routing System

        Route parameters (/user/:id)

        Query parameters (?search=...)

        Chained route handlers (app.route())

        req, res, and next objects

        Serving static files with express.static()

        🛠 3. Template Engines
        What are template engines?

        Using EJS with Express

        Rendering dynamic HTML pages with res.render()

        Passing variables/data to views

        📨 4. Working with Forms and Body Data
        Parsing form data using:

        express.urlencoded()

        express.json()

        Handling POST form submissions

        Input validation (e.g., required fields, length)

        📁 5. Project Structure & Modularity
        Modularizing routes (e.g., /users, /products)

        Creating reusable middleware functions

        Organizing files: routes, views, controllers, middleware

        🔐 6. Authentication & Authorization
        Concept of sessions and cookies

        Using express-session for login systems

        Protecting routes (middleware auth checks)

        Storing user data (basic or with a database)

        Password hashing (e.g., with bcrypt)

        🧪 7. Validation & Error Handling
        Manual validation

        Using libraries like express-validator

        Centralized error-handling middleware

        Showing custom error messages in views

        🛢 8. Database Integration
        Connecting to databases (MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL)

        Using mongoose (for MongoDB)

        Performing CRUD operations

        Reading/writing JSON files for temporary storage

        🔄 9. RESTful API Development
        Designing RESTful routes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

        Returning JSON responses

        Creating a complete REST API backend

        Testing APIs with Postman

        🧩 10. Third-party Middleware & Tools
        morgan (logger)

        cors (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

        cookie-parser

        helmet (security)

        compression (gzip compression)

        🌍 11. Advanced Routing
        Using express.Router()

        Nested routes (e.g., /users/:id/posts)

        Route grouping and prefixing

        🌐 12. CORS & Security
        What is CORS?

        Using the cors middleware

        Security best practices with Express:

        Input sanitization

        HTTP headers (helmet)

        Avoiding eval() and file injections

        📡 13. Working with APIs
        Calling external APIs (using fetch or axios)

        Creating backend endpoints to serve frontend apps

        Sending JSON/XML responses

        ⚙️ 14. Environment & Configuration
        Using .env files and dotenv package

        Configuring ports, database URLs, and secrets securely

        Separation of development vs. production

        🧾 15. Logging & Monitoring
        Request logging with morgan

        Error logging

        Custom log files with fs

        🔁 16. Deploying Express Apps
        Preparing your app for deployment

        Using process.env.PORT and static file serving

        Deploying on:

        Render

        Vercel (with adapter)

        Railway

        Heroku

        VPS (like DigitalOcean)

        Using pm2 in production (for restarting on crash)

        ⚡ 17. Performance Optimization
        Compression middleware

        Load balancing

        Caching strategies (memory or Redis)

        Avoiding blocking code

        🧠 18. Common Patterns & Best Practices
        MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture

        DRY code structure

        Use of async/await in middleware and route handlers

        Error boundaries in async functions
